<b>What does it do?</b>
So this bassically recongises people with the kinect. When it recognises one user, it shows his/her silhoutte with the use of floating balls on the screen. When there are two users it shows the image the kinect gets and when more than three people are pressent an <b>EXPLOSION</b> happens.

<b>How to run it?</b>
For software you are going to need processing (I used 3.5.3) for this, and the library [kinect v2 for processing](http://codigogenerativo.com/kinectpv2/)

And for the hardware a windows pc and a kinect 2 should do it.
